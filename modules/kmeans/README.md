# K-Means Clustering Algorithm in Python

This project implements the **K-Means clustering algorithm** from scratch in Python. It also provides a simple visualization for 2D data points.

## Features

- Randomly initialize centroids
- Assign each point to the nearest centroid
- Update centroids iteratively
- Convergence detection (stops when centroids do not change)
- 2D cluster visualization using Matplotlib
- Easy testing with sample datasets from `sklearn.datasets`

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn (optional, only for generating sample datasets)

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have Python and required libraries installed.
2. Download the repository files (`kmeans.py` and this `README.md`).
3. Open `kmeans.py` in your Python IDE or editor.
4. Run the script:
   ```python
   python kmeans.py
